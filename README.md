## About the challenge :open_file_folder::

In this challenge, you will have to create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to refactor a page for listing films according to genre.

The application is already fully functional but a large part of its code is directly in the `App.tsx` file. To solve this in the best way, it is necessary to divide the application into ** at least ** two main parts: sidebar and the main content that has the header and the list of films.

- The application has only one main feature, which is the listing of films;
- In the sidebar it is possible to select which category of films should be listed;
- The first category on the list (which is "Action") should start as marked;
- The application header has only the name of the selected category that must be changed dynamically.

Below we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done ðŸš€

## Getting started :desktop_computer::
**Clone the project and access the folder**

```bash
$ https://github.com/BootcampIgnite2021/challenge-02-componentizing-application.git && cd challenge-02-componentizing-application
```

**Follow the steps below**

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ yarn
